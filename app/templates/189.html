			<h2>What is the Skilled Independent Visa (Subclass 189)?</h2>
			<p>Australia is an excellent destination for anyone who wishes to start their life over again. Foreign nationals migrate to Australia for the great work opportunities it provides as well as the quality of goods and services available here. The Skilled Independent Visa (Subclass 189) is an excellent option for skilled foreign nationals who wish to reside and get employment permanently in Australia.</p>

			<p>It does not take a nomination from a state, employer or territory in Australia for you to apply for the subclass 189 visa in Australia. It takes an invitation from the Department of Home Affairs to submit the application. By the time the invitation comes from the DHA, you must have an appropriate skills assessment for a valid application. Read on for more about the visa..</p>
